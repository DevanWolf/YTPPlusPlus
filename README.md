## YTP++ is an iteration of [YTP+](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlus), written in C#.
### It includes new features and benefits over the previous iteration, such as:

  - Intro and outro, with toggles
  - Setting width/height for rendered videos
  - Includes FFMPEG and FFPROBE
  - Error handling

## What is YTP+ and YTP++?
YTP+ is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate YouTube Poop videos.
YTP++ is the name given to the second iteration of the software, however there was once a [YTP++ made in Electron and Node.JS](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/ytpplus-node-ui).

## How do I configure YTP++?
All configuration settings may be found in the application itself, either on the interface or in the Tools menu. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is required for the Squidward effect but is otherwise not needed.

## I installed ImageMagick, but Squidward is still disabled?
Try adding magick.exe to your system path. If you've checked the box needed in the installation prompt for ImageMagick, try restarting your computer. If all else fails, try setting magick.exe manually via the Tools menu.

## I got a great idea for the program, where to start?
Anyone is welcome to submit a pull request or suggest ideas via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bzhzRmg).
